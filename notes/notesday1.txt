✅ Git Commands & Concepts - Revision Notes

🔹 Basic Git Commands
git status → Shows current branch and tracked/untracked files.


git add <file> → Stages specific file.


git add . → Stages all modified and new files.


git commit -m "message" → Commits staged changes with a message.


git log → Shows commit history.


git reset <file> → Unstages a file from staging area.


git restore <file> → Discards changes in working directory.


git restore --staged <file> → Removes a file from staging area, but keeps changes.


git stash → Temporarily saves uncommitted changes.


git stash pop → Applies and removes the last stash.



🔹 Forking and Cloning
Fork: Copy a repo to your GitHub profile.
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git



🔹 Remote Repositories



git clone <url> → Clone the forked repo locally.


Example:git remote -v → Lists remotes.


git remote add origin <your-fork-url> → Adds your fork as origin.


git remote add upstream <original-repo-url> → Adds main repo as upstream.


git fetch upstream → Fetches changes from upstream repo.


git pull upstream main → Merges upstream’s main into your local main.



🔹 Branching
git branch → Lists all local branches.


git branch <branch-name> → Creates a new branch.


git checkout <branch-name> → Switches to that branch.


git checkout -b <branch-name> → Creates and switches to new branch.


git push origin <branch-name> → Pushes local branch to your fork.



🔹 Keeping Your Fork Up-to-Date
bash
CopyEdit
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main


🔹 Creating a Pull Request (PR)
Fork the original repo.


Clone your fork locally.


Create a branch:
 git checkout -b feature-xyz


Make changes → git add . → git commit -m "your message"


Push branch to your fork:
 git push origin feature-xyz


Go to GitHub → Open Pull Request:


Base repo: upstream


Base branch: main


Compare: your fork’s feature-xyz


Click Create Pull Request



🔹 Upstream & Rebase
git fetch upstream → Grabs latest changes.


git rebase upstream/main → Re-applies your local commits on top of upstream’s main.


Useful to clean history before PR.



🔹 Conflict at Same Line
Occurs when both upstream and your branch modify the same line.
 To resolve:
Git will mark conflict in file using:

 markdown
CopyEdit
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Upstream changes
>>>>>>> upstream/main


Manually choose which version to keep.


Stage it again: git add <file>


Continue: git rebase --continue or git commit
