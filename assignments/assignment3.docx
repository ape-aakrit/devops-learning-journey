TASK 1 
    1. Start on main, pull latest changes.
    2. Create a new branch feature-test.
    3. Make a simple change (like editing README.md).
    4. Commit and push feature-test to remote.
    5. Open a PR from feature-test to main.
    6. While PR is open, make a change on local main, commit, and push it.
    7. On feature-test, rebase on updated main.
    8. Resolve any conflicts if they arise.
    9. Push rebased feature-test (force push if needed).
    10. Merge the PR on GitHub.
Learnings Summary
    • Created and cloned a GitHub repo with a README file.
    • Worked with branches: created feature-test branch from main.
    • Made changes in different branches and committed them.
    • Opened a Pull Request (PR) from feature-test to main.
    • Made concurrent changes on main while PR was open.
    • Learned how to rebase a feature branch on updated main.
    • Resolved merge conflicts manually during rebase.
    • Used git add and git rebase --continue to complete the rebase process.
    • Pushed changes and handled force push when rewriting branch history.
    • Dealt with remote branch conflicts and learned to pull before pushing to avoid rejections.

       
TASK2

    1. • Initialize a new Git repository named git-rebase-practice.
    2. • Create a file main.txt, add content, and make an initial commit on the main branch.
    3. • Create a new branch called feature-rebase from main.
    4. • On feature-rebase, make two separate commits modifying or adding feature.txt.
    5. • Switch back to the main branch and make one more commit modifying main.txt.
    6. • Rebase the feature-rebase branch onto the updated main branch.
    7. • If there's a conflict during the rebase, resolve it, then continue the rebase.
    8. • After a successful rebase, merge the feature-rebase branch into main.
    9. • Use git log --oneline --graph --all to observe your branch history after rebasing.
    10. • (Optional) Use git reflog to explore the state of the HEAD and recover history if needed.
