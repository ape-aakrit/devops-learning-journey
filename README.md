# 🚀 DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps Learning Journey repository. This is where I document everything I learn as I dive deep into tools like Git, Linux, YAML, and more — including daily notes, hands-on assignments, useful scripts, and resources.

## 📁 Structure

- **assignments/** – Hands-on exercises to reinforce key concepts.
- **scripts/** – Useful shell scripts and command-line snippets.
- **resources/** – Cheatsheets, reference links, and curated material.
